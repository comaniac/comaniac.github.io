Welcome to my personal website. This would be a permanent place (hopefully)
for people to find me.

When writing this post, I am about to start my first full-time job at
AWS AI, Amazon as an applied scientist working with [tvm][1].
I know lots of new grad PhDs cannot get a research position at industry
and probably need to archive their skills of doing research and writing
papers. That's why I finally accepted the offer from AWS rather than
Google or Facebook, because they offer me a position that 1) focuses
on research and can even publish papers, and 2) works for an open
source project. I feel I am fortunate to get a such ideal job right
after my graduation.
